# ScarletShare Prototype
A peer-to-peer course materials exchange for Rutgers undergraduate students.

## How to Run
1. Ensure `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. Use the interface to:
   - Upload materials (textbooks, notes, study guides).
   - Request appointments for physical barter at the Rutgers-Camden hub.
   - View available materials.

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only demo using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- Backend integration (e.g., database, Rutgers SSO) is planned for production.
- Contact the team via GroupMe (https://groupme.com/join_group/105922453/LiV8GaoC) for feedback or questions.
