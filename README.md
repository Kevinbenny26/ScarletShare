# ScarletShare Prototype
A peer-to-peer course materials exchange for Rutgers undergraduate students.

## How to Run
1. Ensure `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. Use the interface to:
   - Upload materials (textbooks, notes, study guides).
   - Request appointments for physical barter at the Rutgers-Camden hub.
   - View available materials.
